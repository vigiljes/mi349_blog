        <h3><em>(10/22/2022)</em> <strong>Jesus Vigil</strong> </h3>
        <p>Ever since culture was formed, humans have used music to add joy to their lives or express emotions.
            Before it became the multibillion dollar industry it is today, people were relating with each other through the
            spread of traditional music, hymns, or even sea chantys. Once music started selling like hotcakes, it started became more of an artform.
            Like films and other forms of media, people wanted to stand out with their sounds and influences by developing new rhythms and practices.
            In these modern times (the past hundred years or so), we have been able to capture sounds like never before. Music at home became more
            common and made the artform more accessible to audiences that wouldn't have interacted with it. This being said, I went down the A&M records
            rabbithole over the past year and was intrigued by it. I bought a random record at a thrift store after purchasing a record player half 
            impulsively and liked what I heard. I wasn't sure why something so "old" stood out to me until I bought more records and found the label on it.
            Now every label with it was a guaranteed good time. I recognized patterns in sounds that I have never heard before through record digging and it
            started with this A&M. That thrift shop record I bought was a Herb Alpert record; he is one of the founders of A&M Records.
