            <p>My name is J.V and I was born and raised in Detroit, MI. 
            I have many interests and hobbies but music is my bread and butter (shouts-out to Motown).
            Many friends and acquaintances have asked me what I <em>don't</em> do after
            meeting them. I like creating no matter what it is and have always had a creative mind.
            I am currently studying <em>Computer Science</em> at <strong>Michigan State University</strong> and have plans to
            one day start my own business. I plan to bring all of my skills and talents together beyond graduation to introduce something
            new to the world.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            When not studying, I am locked in on my Digital Audio Workstation, <em>FL Studio</em>, producing music and working on my own sound. 
            The creativity never stops and neither does the work. Every so often, I take a trip outside and ride my skateboard. I'm probably too old
            to become a pro-skater, but I enjoy reaching milestones with every one of my endeavors. This being said, after almost 10 years of "on-and-off"
            skateboarding, I can land a kickflip with one foot. On top of this physical activity, I also like to run and work out.
